#Notes
#Part A Notes
#Now we are looking in a nuclear power plant (Ironic that nuclear power is back
#in the story, just as people are starting to accept it for our power hungry LLM
#training!) We can't find the historian here, but the elves there would like us
#to take alook at some odd reports.  Our puzzle input, are one of many reports.
#One report is one line, and each line is separated a list of number reffered
#too as levels.
#Our goal:
#Deem which reports are safe.  
# **If all levels are increasing or decreasing** Check Monotocity
# **Any two levels differ by at least one and at most 3**
# We need to report how many of these levels are safe.  

#Part B Notes
#Now we can allow one bad case to get through on the second test. 
#Should be a simple adjustment

#Notes
#Part A Notes
#The theme this year is searching for the Chief Historian!  Everyday will be a
#new location where we will try to find their location before Xmas!  They were sent out
#on expedition to scout historical sites and they've gone missing!  
#
#Starting with an empty list, The search will start at the chief historians office. He's not there
#But they did find lists of where they were going to go for the year.   As the historians 
#split into two groups, each groups tries to reconcile a list of location id's of where
#the chief historian might have gone.  
#
#Initially the two lists are very disimilar.  
# 
# 1. We'll first sort each list from smallest to largest
# 2. for each pair, what is their difference. 
# 3. Add up the list of differences.  Easy peasy

#Part B
#For each value in the left list, if it exists in the right list, 
#Add the value multipled by its number of occurances to the diffs. 
#sum the diffs

#Fun start!
